Rationale,,,,,,,,,
The budget is now has maximum $6500, so we can change the below configuration of all EC2 instance (both m5 and c5 instances) due to the reasons:,,,,,,,,,
"1. Updated from m5.xlarge to m5.large: both require the EBS storage, but m5.xlarge has 4 CPUs and 16Gb memory is to ensure the best performance of the web server instance, while the m5.large has 2 CPUs and 8gb memory and cheaper than m5.xlarge, it is to ensure the sufficient performance (optimal) of the web server instance.",,,,,,,,,
"2. Updated from c5.xlarge to c5.large: both require the EBS storage, but c5.xlarge has 4 CPUs and 8Gb memory is to ensure the best performance of the application server instance, while the c5.large has 2 CPUs and 4gb memory and cheaper than c5.xlarge, it is to ensure the sufficient performance (optimal) of the application server instance.",,,,,,,,,
"3. Updated the payment options from On-demand 100% utilization percent per hours to convertible reverved instances: both options are good, but the convertible reverved instances (cost with no upfront is only 35.77/month for m5 instances, and 62.05/month for c5 instances)  is cheaper than On-demand 100% utilization percent per hours (70.08/month for m5 instances, and 29.93/month for c5 instances)  ",,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
Change the below configuration for RDS instances due to the reasons:,,,,,,,,,
"1. Change the instance type from m5.4xlarge to m5.large: the m5.4xlarge provide 16 CPUs and 64Gbs memory is to ensure the best performance of reading and modification process as posible, the m5.large provide the optimal performance of reading and modification for the insufficient budget case.",,,,,,,,,
